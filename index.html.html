<p class= "intro">Stefan Sagmeister was born in 1962 in Bregenz, Austria. He had his first taste of graphic design at the age of 15 writing articles for an Austrian Youth Magazine when he realised he enjoyed designing  the layout for the articles rather than actually writing them . Today Stefan is a world renowned graphic design icon and is a co-founder of the New York based studio Sagmeister & Walsh. So how did he come from writing articles for a small Austrian magazine at 15 to being a two time Grammy winning designer with a star studded catalogue of clients including the likes of the Rolling Stones and HBO? </p>



<h2 id="early-life">Early Life & Education</h2>



<p>Stefan first studied at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna. At the age of 22, whilst still studying in Vienna, he was commissioned to design a series of posters with the goal of saving an old theatre in Vienna that the city wanted demolished to build an apartment complex. The series was featured in its own show at the 'Gagosian' and was very successful garnering attention from major newspapers and TV stations. It was this project that made him realise the impact his work could have. </p>
        
        <blockquote>“Fuck, this shit really works. I can do something and it has an end result.”

<cite>—Stefan Sagmeister, The Great Discontent Interview, 2014</cite>
</blockquote>
        
        

<p>When he was 23 Stefan was awarded a scholarship to go to New York and study at the Pratt Institute while studying in Vienna. In New York he achieved a Master’s Degree and one of his greatest inspirations while studying was Tibor Kalman, Stefan actually managed to get an interview with him for his thesis. Tibor would become a lifelong mentor and friend of Stefan’s.</p>

<h2 id="hong-kong"2>Hong Kong</h2>


<p>Stefan moved to Hong Kong after working for a year in New York, he would be there for two years.  Whilst there he worked for a large advertising agency called Leo Burnett and opened a design studio for them. The studio worked for some of Leo Burnett’s clients and they also worked with their own clients. From this he learned everything about running a studio.</p>

title="4 As Honk Design Awards poster, 1992"/>
    
<p>One of Stefan’s most notable works created during his time in Hong Kong is the Hong Kong Design award advertisement he created commissioned by the company 4 As in 1992. The advertisement was composed of 2 traditional Cantonese style paintings however one of the paintings depicted 4 men bent over displaying their bare behinds. This was an obvious reference to the company’s name. The piece was not received well by the conservative minded Asian business world and was boycotted by several agencies. Stefan’s favourite response to the piece was “Who’s the asshole that designed the poster?” The advertisement is a clear demonstration Stefan’s humorous style that is designed to provoke a strong reaction whether negative or positive.</p>



    
 
<h2 id="m-and-co">M&Co</h2>



<p>Stefan returned to New York to work with Tibor Kalman at M&Co after two years in Hong Kong. One of his first works at the company was an invitation for an LGBT taskforce gala. What he designed was a nicely packaged box of fresh fruit. This proved a nightmare for the M&Co who struggled to stop the fruit from rotting in the New York summer heat. This was one of the first of Stefan’s plethora of designs involving fruit, fresh or rotted. The invitation again showed his witty approach to his work using fruit to reference the slang terms for gay and lesbian people. There was another funny arc to this project when the invitation ironically bore a quote from the bible, “By their fruits ye shall know them.” (Matthew 7:20). </p>

<p>Stefan learnt a lot from Tibor through working for him and their personal relationship. He said that it was through working at M&Co with Tibor, Stefan learnt to keep the company he would eventually open small as Tibor had lamented that he grew his company too large to about 30 employees.</p>
    
    <p>Only half a year after Stefan had started working at M&Co, Tibor decided to close the studio and move to Rome to become editor-in-chief of Colors magazine. This prompted Stefan to open his own studio.</p>
    
   
<h2 id="sagmeister-inc">Sagmeister Inc</h2>

<img src="images\sagmeister-opening-card-1-0.jpg"

title=" Sagmeister Inc launch postcard, 1993"/>

<p>In 1993 Stefan set up shop in a 2 floor apartment in New York and called his studio Sagmeister Inc. He advertised the opening of the studio in standard fashion with a postcard displaying himself standing completely naked, whilst this may seem particular of Stefan he has said that he was “fearful of it at that point” as he was risking losing the only client he had at the time. The project was a success and the risk paid off and Stefan has said “I think that was an important thing to do as a first project because I needed to overcome my fear.” </p>
    
    <blockquote>“Stefan Sagmeister has always understood the power of getting naked.”

<cite>—Patrick Burgoyne, Creative Review editor </cite>
</blockquote>

<p>Sagmeister Inc started out making album covers for singers and band Stefan liked. The most high profile client Stefan designed an album cover for would probably The Rolling Stones’ for their album Bridge to Babylon in 1997. The cover displays an Assyrian lion embedded into a special manufactured filigree slipcase. Inside the packaging the cover unfolded into a long strip of desert. Sagmeister Inc continued to work for the music industry for the next “seven or so years.”</p>

    <blockquote>"As a graphic problem, I still find that visualisation for music is one of the most juiciest for all."

<cite>—Stefan Sagmeister, Dezeen magazine interview, 2015 </cite>
</blockquote>
    
    <p>Sagmeister Inc eventually began branching out of album covers and in 1999 Stefan produced what is largely regarded as his most famous work to date, the AIGA Detroit poster. The poster was for an event he would be speaking at the poster design is a photograph of Stefan’s’ naked body with the event information carved into his skin with an x-acto knife. He did this to visualise the pain his studio goes through when completing projects. This piece typifies Stefan’s rather straight forward, yet still controversial approach to some of his work and yet again this piece provokes a strong reaction from the audience. The Creative Review said of Stefan “Sagmeister has used his body, literally, to advance his career. He has used nakedness as a way of conveying a promise of daring, wit, bravery and commitment.”</p>

    <p>It is very clear that Sagmeister realised how impactful the use of the naked body was from very early on in his career, the first uses can be seen in his 4As poster and then in his postcard for the launch of Sagmeister Inc. Stefan has said “The human body is just one of the strongest forms there is, one that is incredibly familiar to all of us.” The use of nudity has almost become Sagmeister’s signature style.</p>
    
    
<h2 id="sagmeister-and-walsh">Sagmeister & Walsh</h2>

<img src="images\sagmeister-walsh-card.jpg"

title="Sagmeister & Walsh announcement postcard, 2012"/>

<p>In 2012, 19 years after the opening of Sagmeister Inc, the company was renamed to Sagmeister & Walsh after Jessica Walsh became a founding partner of the business. The studio advertised this new era in the same way it had done 19 years previous, with a postcard featuring a naked Stefan and beside him a naked Jessica Walsh.  </p>
    
    
    
<img src="images\sagmeister-happy-show.jpg"

title=" The Happy Show, 2013"/>
    
<p>Since this rejig of the studio occurred many more iconic works have been produced. In 2013,’The Happy Show’ was held in the Institute of Contemporary Arts. The show took over the entire second floor of the building including the non-exhibition areas. Sagmeister & Walsh’s website describes the show as “the experience of walking into Stefan Sagmeister’s mind as he attempts to increase his happiness via meditation, cognitive therapy, and mood-altering pharmaceuticals.” The walls of the ICA were covered in facts and statistics about happiness and it was also interactive allowing the viewer to rate their own happiness using gumball machines with different numbers, the colour scheme of informational graphics was black white and yellow. Stefan furthered this project into ‘The Happy Film’ in which undergoes a plethora of psychological and chemical processes to test how much a person can control their own happiness, the film premiered at Tribeca Film Festival in April 2016.</p>
    
    
    <p>Sagmeister and Walsh’s most recent work that has garnered a lot of attention is their ‘Pins Won’t Save the World’ which is a protest against the election of Donald Trump as the Next President of the US. The project aimed to allow people to wear their politics by selling a variety of pins, stickers, patches and temporary tattoos designed by various artists that bore various anti-Trump slogans including ‘Dump Trump’, ‘F* Trump’ and ‘Make America Love Again’. These pins were sold online and the proceeds were donated to charities that aid the LGBT community, refugees, abortion rights, women’s rights and African American rights. The Sagmeister & Walsh website stated, “Now, more than ever, we have to resist Trump’s racism, misogyny, xenophobia and homophobia becoming the new normal. We need to stand up for tolerance, equality and unity.” This work is unique as it was not commissioned by any company it was produced directly by Sagmeister & Walsh and it is one of very view directly political pieces Stefan has had a hand in. Interestingly Stefan has said before, “if your aim is to change the world, the most efficient profession to do this in is politics, not design,” yet here a clear effort to make change in the world through design and politics can be seen.</p>

    <p>Today in 2017 Stefan is continuing with the premieres of ‘The Happy Film’ throughout Europe most recently in Austria, Germany & Switzerland. He regularly posts on his social media accounts, including Instagram where he uploads pictures of inspirations, design work he is enjoying and his love of album cover design can be seen through his regular uploads of favourite album packaging by different artists including the likes of Beyoncé, The 1975 and Sohn. The future of Stefan Sagmeister and his work is is something very exciting yet hard to pin point, his methods are ever changing and ever successful so it’s safe to say if he keeps doing what he’s doing, he will do just fine.</p>
